# polaris
Welcome to polaris, a pretty dark, but very colourful KDE Plasma theme.

There are four highlight colour options: oddfish (dark yellow), moonflowers (bloody red), lachesis (a soothing monochrome-ish) and upas (a moody, woody brown). Also has papirus-folders scripts for each colour, which change the folder icons in your file explorer to match the theme's.

Install script and instructions included, so installing this should be a breeze (Also backs up your current dotfiles, so no accidents!)

I hope you like it!
